## Bug Reports

Bug reports are welcome. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

* First, ensure that the bug you're encountering is in this plugin and not part of Journal Transporter. If the issue occurs as part of the transfer process itself, please check [the Journal Transporter repo](https://github.com/castiron/journal-transporter).
* Before submitting an issue, search existing open issues to make sure you're not creating a duplicate. If an issue already exists, comment on it instead of creating a new issue.
* If you're unable to find an open issue about your problem, open a new issue.
  * Write a descriptive title
  * Write a succinct but clear description of the issue. Include a code sample or a link to a sample repo or executable test case.

## Bug Fixes / Enhancements

Pull requests are welcome.

* Fork this repo.
* Start commit messages with a type tag - [F] for features, [C] for chores, [B] for bug fixes.
* If a commit addresses an issue, include the issue number immediately after the type tag.
* Submit a pull request, adhering to the following guidelines:
  * Write a title of the issue(s) addressed by the PR
  * Write a thorough description of the changes being made. If the maintainers can't easily review the code and ensure that it performs as intended, your PR is likely to be rejected.
